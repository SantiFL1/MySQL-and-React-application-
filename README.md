# MySQL-and-React-application-
Application that fetches objects from a MySQL database and shows them using React and Express


In the file "app demonstration" you can see the application running (the API and the React app).

For this application to work, there must exist a MySQL database with the settings that appear in back/server.js. That database must be selected in MySQL workbench, and it must have a table named "new_table" with columns id (primary key, AI), title, artist and year. 

When those database settings are ready, you have to run the API and the front-end, with "npm run start" in both folders (front and back).
